# Chess Game | C# WinForms | Two-Player Chess Game

This project is a two-player chess game built entirely in C# with WinForms, created during my semester break while taking care of my grandmother who was unwell. At the time, I was just beginning my studies and had not yet delved deeply into C# and WinForms. Despite this, I was able to design and build the game from scratch, relying on my self-taught programming knowledge and problem-solving skills.
